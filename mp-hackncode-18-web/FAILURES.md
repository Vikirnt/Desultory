  The reason why this project didn't work
  <hr>
</div>

1. I had very little experience with Django REST Framework and did not understand how everything worked. I didn't know I had to 
exclude the user password from fields. If I wanted to add a new features it took me an hour to get that in.
Seriously, in a hackathon, use what you know best.

2. I was using a remote database the whole time. This slowed my development speed.

3. Django refused to migrate some of my apps. I had to drop the database table several times and ask my friend to write dummy data
over and over again. This is completely wrong.

4. The choice of the database, the model schemas. It was all mismatched. This project needs a NoSQL database. And Django is not
apt for NoSQL. I should have used Firebase instead.

5. The lack of database and backend slowed down speed of Android development. Maybe if I had a dummy database set up already,
they could have completed the application sooner and started fixing bugs sooner.

6. Use the right tools! Every programming language, every framework, every library that you learn - they all add to your toolbox.
You cannot use a hammer to tighten a screw.
