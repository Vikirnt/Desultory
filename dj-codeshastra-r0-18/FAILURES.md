  The reason why this project didn't work
  <hr>
</div>

Before I move forward. This was my first hackathon. We were freshmen, with no hackathon programming experience. Even though this project failed, it taught me a lot. When I went home that day, I understood that I understand nothing. There was a lot more to learn than just going though the tutorials of a framework.

Now, on to the failures:

1. I went to this hackathon after knowing only the basics of Django and backend development.

2. I failed to understand how HTTP works.

3. I failed to understand how to integrate everything.

4. I lacked knowledge and went to the hackathon anyway.
